If your reading this, I've either passed away or am missing.

This drive is a backup access key for my digital life.

If all steps followed correctly access to my Dashlane Account will be granted.
(Dashlane is my password manager and give access to all my other accounts)

Should there be any issues, please talk to my friend Max (Maton) who will be able to assist with technical issues.

-- Access code Generation --
1.  Find my home server (located in my network rack at my home) and make sure it is powered on.
2.  On this SD card you should fine a file called "ssh.txt" which will contain a username and password to ssh to this server.
    (If your on my home network, unplug the ethernet cable from any Apple TV an use that to connect your own computer. The servers IP address will be 10.0.10.254)
3.  Once connected, run the following command: "python3 RequestAccess.py".
4.  Wait 7 days (Script will enforce this period to make sure access not given in error, and notification will be sent to my email).
5.  Use steps 1-3 to run the script again which will output a access code. Take note of this code.

-- Unlock credentials --
6.  Use the code from step 5 to unlock the encrypteed zip file on this SD card named data.zip.

-- Decide Access Method --
7. I've setup to access methods, with and without phone.
8. With access to my phone use step 10-11.
9. Without access to my phone use steps 12-y.

-- Phone Access --
10. Use the pincode in the phone_pincode.txt file to unlock my phone.
11. Use the password located in the dashlane_credentials.txt to access the dashlaine app.

-- Gmail Access --
12. In the data.zip you should fine "gmail_credentials.txt" which will provide username, password and 2fa backup codes
13. Use credentials from step 8 to long into my gmail account.
14. Setup your phone for 2fa on the account to retain access

-- Dashlane Access --
15. In the data.zip you should fine "dashlane_credentials.txt" which will provide username, password
16. Use credentials from step 10 to long into my dashlane account.
17. A 2fa code may be sent to my gmail account, log in there to find this if needed.
